For the semester project in the Data Warehousing course, our focus was on developing a prototype for the Electronica Business chain's Data Warehouse, employing the Hybrid Join method pioneered by Dr. Muhammad Asif Naeem, our esteemed professor for the course.

The primary objective of our project was to construct a comprehensive data warehouse integrating both master data and transactional data, particularly focusing on customer transactions within Electronica, a prominent Electronics Business chain operating in Pakistan and globally. With a vast customer base across its numerous stores, Electronica recognizes the critical importance of analyzing customer shopping behaviors in real-time to refine selling strategies, such as offering targeted promotions on various products.

To enable practical analysis of shopping behavior, the establishment of a near-real-time Data Warehouse (DW) was imperative, ensuring that customer transactions from Data Sources (DSs) seamlessly reflect in the DW as they occur. Achieving near-real-time DW functionality necessitates the implementation of near-real-time ETL (Extraction, Transformation, and Loading) tools. Given the diverse formats of data generated by customers, the transformation layer of ETL plays a pivotal role in processing and enhancing this data, such as enriching attributes sourced from disk-based Master Data (MD).

Incorporating the enrichment functionality within the transformation phase of ETL demands a robust join operator. Among the various algorithms available for this purpose, the Hybrid Join stands out as the most widely adopted, providing an effective means to integrate disparate datasets. In our project, we meticulously implemented the Hybrid Join algorithm using Java Eclipse, ensuring seamless integration and transformation of data streams within the Electronica Business chain's Data Warehouse environment.
